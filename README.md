## Style guide (R5)

Identify any code style guide or styling conventions that the application will adhere to.

The development of this application adheres to the [PEP 8 Style Guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and [PEP 257 Docstring Conventions](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/). In particular, the following conventions are followed:

- Maximum 79 characters per lines of code, 72 characters per lines of comments and docstrings.Implied line continuation inside parentheses are mainly used to break down longer codes and strings.
- snake_cases for variable and module names
- Double quote characters are used for strings
- Docstrings and comments are used to explain modules, functions, classes and methods after the `def` line.
- imports are put at the top of the file in separate lines

## Features (R6)

Word Pie consists of the following features:

### Draw a random word from a given word list

- The program will read the txt file in the given directory and generate a word list; it will then select a random word for user to guess.
- Error handling is integrated to deal with cases when the text file is empty or contains no word more than 2 characters.
- The random word is stored in a variable to allow for further uses.

### Takes user input and check if it follows game's rule

- The program reveals the number of letters for the word and asks the user to take a guess. It then compares the guessed with the answer.
- It validates that the guess is an English word and/or contains alphabetic letters only. Loops and conditional structures are utilised to repeatedly ask for user input until a valid response is received.

#### Allow user to restart and quit the game at any time

- This can be considered as the sub-feature for taking user input. Conditionals and error handling is utlisied, so that when the user types special commands, exception (including a custom exception class) will be raised and then catched outside the loop to restart/quit the game gracefully.

### Compare user's guess with answer and display differences

- The program checks the guess to see if it matches the answer. Two functions are used - one is to check if the guess equals to answer, and is used as a condition in the if/else statement. The other function is to analyse and display which letters are correct (in the answer word and in the same place), misplaced or wrong (not in the word).
- External package Rich is used to highlight letters in different colours.

### Display progress information throughout the gameplay

- The user has a certain number of attempts to guess the word. Loops are used to repeatedly get input until the user runs out of chances. Guessing the correct word early will also break the loop.
- During each round, relevant information will be displayed including the user's previous guesses, number of chances used and total chances, spell check status (whether the program will check if the user's guess is an English word), as well as some narrative text.

### Show ending message based on result

- The game will display different ending message when user fails/succeeds in guessing the word.
- Random package is used so that the message text will not be the same everytime.

### Export records as text file

- The user will be able to export formatted records as txt files and the program will display the exported file path.
- They have the option to export records of one round each time game ends, where the save file will be named after the start time of the session; or they can go to settings and export all the records into one file, with file name being their profile name.

### Customise player profile and settings

- The player can access settings and have a number of customise options, including renaming, selecting the word list, toggling spell check status, setting the number of chances, exporting records as txt file and clearing all records. The player profile will also be displayed each time they open settings.
- Player class is created to encapsulate all the relevant information of the user. When instance of the class is created, methods such as getters and setters are imported and can be used in both main play and settings mode.
- bash scripts are used to pass on arguments to the python file, and with the help of conditional structures, the player can easily switch between 'play' and 'settings' mode.

### Save and load data using json

- Player's information will be exported to a json file and imported back to the object when the program reopens.
- Error handling is utlitised to deal with missing or corrupted files - when it catches relevant exceptions, default information will be set to allow the program to continue.

## Implementation Plan (R7)

Here's an overview of how the application flows:
![flowchart](docs/wordpie_flowchart.drawio.png)

### Features plan

The following MVP features are prioritised:

- Generate a random 5-letter word (due: 4 May)
  - revisit pytest
  - find a dictionary or word list package
  - import package and experiment
  - create word list and filter out bad words
  - write test case
  - import random package and write code
  - run test case
- Take and analyse user input (due: 5 May)
  - write test case
  - write code - ask for user input
  - write function that tests if input is a valid English word
  - write function that tests if input is equal to answer
  - write function to break down guessed word into letters and check if each letter is in answer and in the correct position; return result as a list of numbers for now
  - run test case
- Add main play loop and show ending message (due: 6 May)
  - set a variable for max number of chances and use it to set loop
  - display number of chances left in each round
  - check if the input is already guessed
  - show winning message when input equals answer
  - show losing message when running out of chances (use for else loop)
  - write code to reveal answer when game lost
- Highlight letters based on analysis (due: 6 May)
  - find a colouring package
  - import package and experiment
  - write test case
  - refactor code and add colouring to analysis
  - run test case
- Export record as txt file (due: 7 May)
  - revisit file handling
  - decide ecport content and file type
  - write test case
  - write function for file handling
  - add date time suffix to file path
  - run test case
- Play again and give up commands (due: 7 May)
  - add "play again?" message at the end of play loop
  - write code for play again
  - write "thank you message" displayed at the end of the game
  - use exception raising and error handling to respond to restart and quit commands (via breaking out of loop)
- Check spelling of the guess (due: 7 May)
  - explore spellcheck package
  - write test case
  - write conditional statements that checks spelling and ask user to input again if misspelled
  - write function to allow user to disable spellcheck
  - run test case

After ensuring all the core features above are running efficiently, the following bonus features are implemented:

- Add user profile (due: 10 May)
  - create a player class and store all the relevant attributes and methods
  - add save data function to class
  - auto save data in the main play loop
  - set and display player name
  - export user data to json file
  - load player data at the start of a game
  - refactor spell check - make it only changeable in player settings instead of main play
- Customise player settings (due: 11 May)
  - add different word lists to directory
  - refactor code - to add function to take file path as parameter and create word list, and to set default word list in user profile
  - test word list with 7-letter words to see if the core functionality will not break
  - custom number of chances function
  - rename function
  - improve custom word list - use number commands instead of typing whole file path
- Export records (due: 11 May)
  - write function to export all records
  - revise function to export one record
  - find way to make the two function codes DRY
